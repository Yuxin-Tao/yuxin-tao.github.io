Hi! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech).
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the [Center for Statistical Science](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en), Tsinghua University, fortunate to be advised by Professor [Dong Li](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/teachers/dongli/). In 2023, I visited the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/home) at Harvard University for one year, fortunate to be mentored by Professor [Zheng (Tracy) Ke](https://zke.fas.harvard.edu).

My primary research interests lie in the field of financial econometrics, non-linear time series analysis, network analysis, ranking inference and topic modeling. Besides, I have a broad interest in exploring the interactions of statistics with various disciplines, and considering ways in which statisticians can better contribute to the wider scientific community.

There are some openings for potential Ph.D. and Master's students, research assistants, and postdocs. Please feel free to contact me with your CV if you are interested.
